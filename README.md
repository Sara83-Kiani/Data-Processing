## What We Built

### Core Features Implemented
- **Authentication System**: Secure user registration and login with JWT tokens, password hashing using bcrypt, and account activation tracking
- **Content Management**: Browse movies and series with genre and age classification filtering
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive MySQL database with 15 tables including proper foreign keys, indexes, and relationships
- **RESTful API**: Clean endpoint structure following REST principles with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Object-Oriented Design**: All entities use proper OOP principles with private fields, getters/setters, and business logic methods

### API Endpoints Available

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - Create a new account with email validation
- `POST /auth/login` - Login and receive JWT access token

#### Content Browsing
- `GET /content/movies` - Get all movies (supports age filtering with `?minAge=13`)
- `GET /content/movies/:id` - Get specific movie details
- `GET /content/movies/search?q=query` - Search movies by title
- `GET /content/series` - Get all series (supports age filtering)
- `GET /content/series/:id` - Get series details with episodes
- `GET /content/series/:id/episodes` - Get episodes (filter by season with `?season=1`)
- `GET /content/genres` - List all available genres
- `GET /content/classifications` - List all age classifications

### Database Structure
We designed a normalized database with the following main tables:
- **Account** - User accounts with authentication details, referral codes, and trial tracking
- **Profile** - Multiple profiles per account (max 4) with age restrictions
- **Subscription** - Different subscription tiers (SD, HD, UHD) with pricing
- **Movie/Series/Episode** - Content catalog with metadata
- **Genre & Classification** - Content categorization and age ratings
- **Watchlist & WatchHistory** - User viewing preferences and progress tracking
- **Invitation** - Referral system for discounts
- **ActivationToken & PasswordReset** - Account security features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Docker installed on your machine:

**Windows**: [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)  
**Mac**: [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) (check your architecture: x64/arm64)  
**Linux**: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project** to your local machine

2. **Create the environment file**  
   Rename `.env.TEMPLATE` to `.env` and configure your database settings:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=mysql
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=rootpassword
   DB_DATABASE=mydb

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
   ```

3. **Prepare Docker Compose**  
   Rename `docker-compose.yamlTEMPLATE` to `docker-compose.yaml`

4. **Create MySQL data folder**  
   Create an empty folder called `mysqldata` in the project root (this stores your database)

5. **Start the application**  
   Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   The first build takes a few minutes. Wait until you see:
   ```
   🚀 StreamFlix API is running on: http://localhost:3000
   ```

6. **Access the services**
   - **API**: http://localhost:3000
   - **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8080 (login with root/rootpassword)

## Testing the API

### Using PowerShell (Windows)

**Register a new account:**
```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "test@streamflix.com"
    password = "Test123456"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/auth/register" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Login:**
```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "test@streamflix.com"
    password = "Test123456"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/auth/login" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Browse content:**
```powershell
# Get all movies
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/content/movies"

# Get all genres
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/content/genres"

# Search movies
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/content/movies/search?q=action"
```

### Using Your Browser

For GET requests, just visit these URLs:
- http://localhost:3000/content/movies
- http://localhost:3000/content/series
- http://localhost:3000/content/genres
- http://localhost:3000/content/classifications

### Using Postman (Recommended)

Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for a better testing experience with a graphical interface.

✅ User registration with email validation  
✅ Secure login with JWT tokens  
✅ Content browsing (movies, series, episodes)  
✅ Age-based content filtering  
✅ Search functionality  
✅ Proper database relationships and constraints  
✅ OOP design patterns in all entities  

### What's Next

- Watchlist functionality (add/remove content)
- Watch history tracking with resume position
- XML response format support
- Database views and stored procedures
- Role-based access control

## Troubleshooting

**Database connection errors?**  
Make sure MySQL container is fully started before the API tries to connect. Check Docker logs with `docker compose logs mysql`

**Port already in use?**  
If port 3000 or 3306 is taken, modify the ports in `docker-compose.yaml`

**Can't import SQL file?**  
Make sure you've selected the correct database (`mydb`) in phpMyAdmin before importing

**API returns empty arrays?**  
The database starts empty. You need to add sample data through phpMyAdmin or SQL inserts
